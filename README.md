# Linear-Algebra

This repository includes all of my MATLAB code and other files used for Linear Algebra (01:640:250) at Rutgers University. 

Specifically, I've included: 

1. my completed labs (.txt files), 
2. the supporting .m files, and 
3. the generated figures

*Linear??? I barely know her!*
